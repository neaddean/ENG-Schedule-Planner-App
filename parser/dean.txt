EC551 - Advanced Digital Design with Verilog and FPGAs 

Class: Tuesday and Thursday, 4pm - 6pm in PHO 201 

Lab: Section N/A, Tuesdays and Fridays, 2-4pm in PHO 115 

Number of credits: 4, Prerequisites: EC311, EC413 

Course Objectives 

Content includes the use of a hardware description language (HDL; in particular Verilog) for the 
specification, synthesis, simulation, and exploration of principles of register transfer level (RTL) designs. 
Programmable logic, such as field programmable gate array (FPGA) devices, has become a major 
component of digital design. In this class the students learn how to write HDL models that can be 
automatically synthesized into integrated circuits using FPGAs. Laboratory and homework exercises 
include writing HDL models of combinational and sequential circuits, synthesizing models, performing 
simulation, writing testbench modules, and synthesizing designs to an FPGA by using automatic place 
and route CAD tools. The course contains lab work and is based on a sequence of Verilog design 
examples leading to a final group project.

Goals 
To provide students with: 

•  An experience of how to write HDL models that can be automatically synthesized into integrated 

circuits using programmable hardware such as FPGAs. 

•  An understanding of how to take a electronic design from concept to register transfer level (RTL) 

verification and synthesis to final programmable device implementation. 

•  An experience in writing HDL models of combinational and sequential circuits, synthesizing 

models, performing simulation, writing test modules, and fitting designs within resource, power, 
and timing constraints of an FPGA by using automatic place and route CAD software. 
 

Course Outcomes 

As an outcome of completing this course, students should be able to: 

•  Understand advanced topics in digital logic design 
•  Understand proven design methodologies based on standard CAD tools 
•  Understand the differences and similarities in hardware and software design 
•  Understand modern specification methods (HDL) 
•  Design combinational devices with a full set of CAD tools (skills) 
•  Understand modeling and verification with hardware description languages 
•  Understand synthesis with HDLs 
•  Understand programmable logic devices and FPGAs 
•  Design state machines, datapath controllers, and assorted CPUs with a full set of CAD tools 
•  Understand synchronization across clock domains 
•  Understand timing analysis 
•  Understand fault simulation and testing

Class participation will help your grade if you are on the border of a grade (e.g. B+ to A-). Class 
participation includes but is not limited to answering questions in class, attending offices hours, helping 
others when appropriate in the lab, and serving in a leadership role in your project group. 

Homework 

Homework assignments will be posted on the Blackboard website two weeks ahead of their due dates. 
Homework is to be submitted outside of PHO 335 or in class before the beginning of the lecture (4:05 
sharp) on the date specified. You can discuss your work in the abstract with other students in the class, 
but you must write-up the solutions on your own. 
 
Labs 

Lab descriptions will be posted on the Blackboard website two weeks ahead of their due dates. Lab 
assignments are done in groups of two students. You may remain in the same group for the whole 
semester or change groups with each lab. This is up to you. Any partner conflicts should be reported 
EARLY to Prof. Densmore. 
 

Exams 

There will be one midterm exam and a final exam. The midterm will be 10/13 in class. If you are unable 
to attend this date, you must provide 1 week advance notice along with appropriate documentation. 
The final exam is 12/16 from 3-5pm. Make up final exams will only be given under extreme 
circumstances. 

Project 

Work as a team of three to four students. Project presentations will be during the last week of classes 
(see schedule). Project presentations will be done in front of all students and should be treated as a 
professional presentation. More information regarding the projects will be provided closer to the 
project due date. 
 

Course Policy 

•  Homework/Lab: The homework assignments must be the result of your individual work (HW) or you 

and your partner (labs). 
 

•  You may discuss the contents and general approach to a problem with your classmates but not the 

detailed solution. You are expected to formulate your approach and to write the solutions of 
HW/Lab problems by yourself/group. Copying the solution and/or answer from another student is 
considered cheating. Two identical HWs/Labs with same mistakes are considered cheating. No 
extensions on homeworks or labs will be provided. If you will be absent on a day they are due you 
should make arrangement in advance with Prof. Densmore. 

 
•  Makeup exams: Makeup exams will be provided if the student receives prior permission from the 

instructor. Emergencies will be dealt on a case-by-case basis. Note that oversleeping, being not 

 

3 

 

ready, or overload due to projects or coursework in other classes are not valid excuses for 
requesting a makeup exam. 

 
•  Exam/Home/Lab Grade discussion: Grade discussion/corrections should be done within one week 

after the graded exam of homework is distributed. No grade changes will be made after one week, 
or after the last day of class.  

I and W grades: As per University policy. 

 
• 
 
•  Honor Code: If you are found cheating on HWs, labs, or examinations, you will be brought up on 

charges before the Student Academic Conduct Committee whose punishment may include 
suspension from the University without the right to transfer credits for courses taken elsewhere.
