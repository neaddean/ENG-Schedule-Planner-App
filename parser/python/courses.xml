    <description>This course aims to introduce students to software design, programming techniques, data structures, and software engineering principles. The course is structured bottom up, beginning with basic hardware followed by an understanding of machine language that controls the hardware and the assembly language that organizes that control. It then proceeds through fundamental elements of functional programming languages, using C as the case example, and continues with the principles of object-oriented programming, as principally embodied in C++ but also its daughter languages Java, C#, and objective C. The course will conclude with an introduction to elementary data structures and algorithmic analysis. Throughout, the course develops core competencies in software engineering, including programming style, optimization, debugging, compilation, and program management, utilizing a variety of Integrated Development Environments and operating systems. 4 cr.</description>

    <description>Breakthroughs in clean energy generation technologies and the advantage of exploiting efficiently the available work in fossil fuels will render electricity the dominant energy form in a sustainable environment future. We review the key characteristics of Electric Power Transmission and Distribution (T&amp;D) networks and the associated planning and operation requirements that ensure supply adequacy, system security and stability. Capital asset investment and operation cost minimization is discussed in a systems engineering context where the assets as well as the dynamic behavior of generators, T&amp;D networks, and loads interact. Recent developments in the formation of competitive wholesale markets at the High Voltage Transmission system level, the associated market participation and clearing rules and the market clearing optimization algorithms are presented and analyzed in terms of their effectiveness in fostering cost reflective price signals and competitive conditions that encourage optimal distributed/not-centralized investment and operating decisions. Finally, we present T&amp;D congestion and supply-demand imbalance related barriers to the widespread adoption of environmentally friendly and economically efficient technological breakthroughs, and propose a systems engineering and real-time retail-market based coordination of centralized as well as decentralized generation, storage and load management resources that is able to achieve desirable synergies and mitigate these barriers. 4 cr</description>

    <description>This course provides students with the knowledge and tools necessary to create, protect, and commercialize engineering and scientific intellectual assets. Students will first make use of creativity tools to attack posed engineering problems, then turn to means for protecting their solutions. Rapidly growing areas that are affecting nearly all businesses (e.g., software and the internet) as well as &quot;high-tech&quot; areas including microelectronics, communications, and bioenegineereing will be emphasized. Extensive patent searches and analysis will be carried out to develop skills for quickly ascertaining the protected technical content of patents, and for recognizing what intellectual property (IP) should be and can be protected. Legal aspects for protecting creative ideas will be studied at a level appropriate for engineers to interact easily and smoothly during their technical careers with IP lawyers. Various business models for the commercialization of intellectual assets will be analyzed. Extensive class exercises and projects will explore in depth all three of these important areas of IP, with emphasis on key contributions during engineering and scientific research and development activities.  </description>

    <cid>543</cid>
    <description>Breakthroughs in clean energy generation technologies and the advantage of exploiting efficiently the available work in fossil fuels will render electricity the dominant energy form in a sustainable environment future. We review the key characteristics of Electric Power Transmission and Distribution (T&amp;D) networks and the associated planning and operation requirements that ensure supply adequacy, system security and stability. Capital asset investment and operation cost minimization is discussed in a systems engineering context where the assets as well as the dynamic behavior of generators, T&amp;D networks, and loads interact. Recent developments in the formation of competitive wholesale markets at the High Voltage Transmission system level, the associated market participation and clearing rules and the market clearing optimization algorithms are presented and analyzed in terms of their effectiveness in fostering cost reflective price signals and competitive conditions that encourage optimal distributed/not-centralized investment and operating decisions. Finally, we present T&amp;D congestion and supply-demand imbalance related barriers to the widespread adoption of environmentally friendly and economically efficient technological breakthroughs, and propose a systems engineering and real-time retail-market based coordination of centralized as well as decentralized generation, storage and load management resources that is able to achieve desirable synergies and mitigate these barriers. 4 cr.   </description>

    <description>The world at the nanometer-scale is full of dynamic phenomena that are vastly different than those encountered at the macro scale. Biological processes that are of particular contemporary interest, such as cell differentiation, are stimulated by the activity and interaction of biomolecules at the nanoscale.  Thus, an understanding of the physics and engineering in such systems is a vital component toward overcoming an immense array of challenging problems in the biological and medical sciences. This course will focus particularly on a conceptual and mechanistic understanding of technologies that permit the study of events at the nanometer scale, including scanning probe microscopes (including SEM and AFM) and optical methods such as fluorescence microscopy and related techniques (including single particle tracking, FRET, FCS). Finally, two laboratory components in optical trap microscopy and microrheology will be the cornerstone of the course. These two labs will each develop over the course of 5 weeks each, thus providing an experiential aspect to lab learning that will require the willingness to take intellectual risks and teamwork. These &quot;hands on&quot; laboratory modules will uniquely prepare students to face the open-ended, teamwork-oriented problems. </description>

    <description>Develops neural network models of how internal representations of sensory events and cognitive hypotheses are learned and remembered, and how such internal representations enable recognition and recall of these events to occur. Various neural pattern recognition models are analyzed. Special emphasis is placed on stable self-organization of pattern recognition and recall codes in unpredictable and noisy environments, notably by adaptive resonance theory models, and on how such codes direct attention toward predictively relevant combinations of features, while attenuating irrelevant background cues. Experimental data and theoretical predictions from cognitive psychology, neuropsychology, and neurophysiology of normal and abnormal individuals are analyzed. </description>

    <description>Develops neural and computational models of how humans and animals learn to successfully predict environmental events and generate behavioral actions that satisfy internally defined criteria of success or failure. Reinforcement learning and its homeostatic (drive, arousal, rhythm) and nonhomeostatic (reinforcement) modulators are analyzed in depth. Recognition learning and recall learning networks are joined to the reinforcement learning network to analyze how these several processes cooperate to generate successful goal-oriented behavior. Maladaptive behaviors and certain mental disorders are analyzed from a unified theoretical perspective. Applications to the design of freely moving adaptive robots are noted. </description>
