  <course name="General Chemistry 1">
    <school>CAS</school>
    <dept>CH</dept>
    <cid>101</cid>
    <description>For science majors and minors who require a two-semester general chemistry course. Topics include: atoms and molecules; molecular connectivity, infrared spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry; stoichiometry and introduction to reactions in aqueous solutions; thermochemistry and the first law of thermodynamics; quantum aspects of light and matter; and bonding in diatomic and polyatomic molecules. Laboratory exercises include: the size of an atom, qualitative analysis, thermochemistry, and quantum aspects of light and matter. Students must register for the following four course components: lecture, discussion, pre-lab lecture and laboratory. Carries natural science divisional credit (with lab) in CAS.</description>
